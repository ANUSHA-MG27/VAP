The Automatic Toll System is a project designed to demonstrate an automated toll gate mechanism using Arduino. The system leverages an ultrasonic sensor to detect vehicles approaching the toll gate, and a servo motor is used to open and close the gate. This project showcases a simple yet effective solution to automate toll booth operations.
